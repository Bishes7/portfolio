      <h2>My Homelab</h2>
      <p>
        Most of my hands-on experience comes from my <strong>homelab</strong>. I
        I regularly do MERN stack projects, set up servers, manage networks,
        explore emerging technologies. This hands-on practice helps me stay
        up-to-date and continuously improve my skills.
